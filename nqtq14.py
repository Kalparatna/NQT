'''
Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of rightmost different bit 1) in binary representation of numbers.

Input:

Two space separated integers M and N.

Output:

Print the position of rightmost different bit in binary representation of numbers.

Constraints:

1 <= M <= 103

1 <= N <= 103

M and N takes different Values

Example:

Input:

11 9

52 4

Output: 
2 
5
