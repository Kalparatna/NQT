2. Minimum Team Selection to Cover Required Skills
Problem Statement:
You are given a list of required skills and a list of candidates, where each candidate has a subset of skills. Your task is to find the smallest possible team such that all required skills are covered.

You will be given:
1. Required skills list
2. Number of candidates (N)
3. Skillsets of N candidates

Return the indices of selected candidates forming the smallest team.

Example:
Input:
a b c d
4
a b
b c
c d
d
Output:
0 2

Input:
a b c
3
a
b c
c
Output:
0 1
