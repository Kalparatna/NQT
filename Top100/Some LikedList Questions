🔰 Beginner Level
These help you understand the basics of linked lists.

Create a singly linked list and print it

Insert a node at the beginning, end, or any given position

Delete a node at the beginning, end, or any position

Find the length of a linked list (iterative and recursive)

Search for an element in the linked list

Reverse a linked list (iterative and recursive)

Find the middle element of a linked list ✅ (You already did this)

🧩 Intermediate Level
These involve more logic or pointer manipulation.

Detect a loop in a linked list (Floyd’s Cycle Detection)

Remove a loop from a linked list

Find the nth node from the end of a linked list

Check if the linked list is a palindrome

Merge two sorted linked lists

Remove duplicates from a sorted or unsorted linked list

Find the intersection point of two linked lists

Add two numbers represented by linked lists

⚙️ Advanced Level
These are more algorithmically heavy and are common in interviews.

Sort a linked list using Merge Sort

Clone a linked list with next and random pointers

Rotate a linked list k times

Flatten a multi-level linked list

Segregate even and odd nodes

Reverse nodes in k-group

Detect and remove duplicate nodes in O(n) time using hashing

Check whether a linked list is circular

Convert a binary tree to a doubly linked list (in-order traversal)

🧠 Bonus: Trickier Challenges
Flatten a linked list where each node has a next and a down pointer

Copy a linked list where each node has a random pointer

Rearrange linked list in the form: L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 …

Intersection of two linked lists using length difference

Find the first non-repeating character using a linked list (streaming)
