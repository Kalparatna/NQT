## Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = a1 - a2 between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
Output: 3
```
Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abcabcab"
Output: 1
```
Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
 

Constraints:
```
3 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.

```


``` python

class Solution:
    def maxDifference(self, s: str) -> int:
        fre = {}

        for ch in s:
            fre[ch] = fre.get(ch, 0) + 1

        odd_freqs = []
        even_freqs = []

        for count in fre.values():
            if count % 2 == 1:
                odd_freqs.append(count)
            else:
                even_freqs.append(count)

        if not odd_freqs or not even_freqs:
            return 0  

        return max(odd_freqs) - min(even_freqs)

sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxDifference("aaaaabbc"))      
print(sol.maxDifference("abcabcab"))     
print(sol.maxDifference("aabbcc"))
