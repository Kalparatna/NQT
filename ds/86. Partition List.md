## Partition List

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
 ```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
-200 <= x <= 200 
```
### Solution

```python
from typing import Optional

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def build_linked_list(values):
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy
    for val in values:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return dummy.next

def print_linked_list(head):
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    print(result)

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        before_head = ListNode(0)
        after_head = ListNode(0)

        before = before_head
        after = after_head

        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                before.next = head
                before = before.next
            else:
                after.next = head
                after = after.next
            head = head.next

        after.next = None  
        before.next = after_head.next  

        return before_head.next

obj = Solution()

input_list = build_linked_list([1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2])
x = 3
output_list = obj.partition(input_list, x)

print_linked_list(output_list)
